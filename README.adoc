📘 AWARE-Micro – Customized Build for Digital Phenotyping

This repository contains a customized version of the AWARE Microservice designed specifically for our Digital Phenotyping Capstone project. It integrates seamlessly with the AWARE backend running on our VMware environment and enables secure processing of sensor-based behavioral data.

------

📦 Setup & Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/PiranhaQTR/Digital-Phenotyping-Backend.git
cd Digital-Phenotyping-Backend

2. Install Dependencies

🔌 Connect to Your AWARE Backend

This custom build expects a running AWARE server.
Set your backend URL in your environment config using the IP address of the VM you're on:

AWARE_BASE_URL=http://<VM-IP>:8080
STUDY_KEY=<your-study-key>   ---> (unused right now)

------

Your mobile application or ingestion services will push sensor data to this backend automatically once configured.

📊 Sensor Data Supported:
Category	                      Sensors Included
Device Sensors	                Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Pedometer, Location
Software Sensors	              Notifications, Screen Events, Battery Status

These are stored in AWARE’s default MySQL tables and can be queried for analytics.
